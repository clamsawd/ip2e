ip2e - How to use
=================

STEPS TO USE:
-------------

  * Create a valid configuration file:
  
    - First, you must create the configuration file needed to run 'ip2e' correctly. 
      To do this, run the tool called 'ip2e-config.py':
      
      $ ./ip2e-config.py

   * Run the daemon:
   
    - When are configured the necessary data of the email sender & receiver, you can 
      run the tool called 'ip2e-daemon.py':
      
      $ ./ip2e-daemon.py
      
    - When daemon is running you can see the log file running the 'ip2e-log.py' tool:
    
      $ ./ip2e-log.py

WINDOWS NOTES:
--------------

     - If you want to run ip2e-daemon.py without visible terminal, you must use the script 
       'ip2e-daemon.vbs' located in win32\ip2e-daemon.vbs. Copy the script in the root
       directory or at the same directory of 'ip2e-daemon.py' and double click about him.
